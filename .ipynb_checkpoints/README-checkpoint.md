# LinkedIn-Skills-Predictor

idea: a live updating dashboard with analytics on the data science and machine learning market across europe and the united states. 
this would show supply side and demand side with many underlying prediction and NLP models


- demand across industries
- gaps in industries 
- the type of experience demanded (under all the fluff)
- the type of skills present in the market (possible to scrape either linkedin or better yet, github - to get the types of tools, technologies and skills levels of the present candidates
- etc
